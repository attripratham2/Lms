  summary: 'Determine menu accessibility based on user capabilities',
  description: `This endpoint assesses whether a user is authorized to access a specific menu item based on their capabilities within the system. The primary function is to facilitate the rendering of user-specific menus by ensuring that each item aligns with the permissions of the current user.

**Authentication:** This endpoint requires that users are authenticated. Unauthorized access attempts will be met with a rejection response indicating insufficient permissions.

**Permissions:** Users must possess the appropriate role-based permissions to interact with the requested menu item. The specific permissions are evaluated as part of the endpoint's logic to ensure compliance with the system's access control policies.

Upon receiving a request, the \`getIfKnowHowToUseRest\` handler within the \`menu.rest.js\` file launches an internal process that begins with the verification of the user's authentication state. Post-authentication, the flow advances to permission checking, mapped to the requested menu item through a fine-grained access control mechanism. This check determines the user's capacity to view or interact with the menu item. Subsequently, a method is invoked to fetch the necessary menu data from the underlying data store, entailing a possible sequence of function calls and database queries. These operations culminate in the endpoint's response, which either presents the accessible menu data to the authenticated and authorized user or denies access with an appropriate message outlining the reason for the denial.`,
